# Travel Mosaic

## Description
Travel Mosaic is a collaborative web application designed to help users plan their travel itineraries for upcoming trips. With features that allow users to add activities, create packing lists, and track budgets, we aim to enhance the travel planning experience for everyone.

- What was your motivation?
  Our team was motivated by the need to better organize our trips and activities. After experiencing challenges such as overbooking days and forgetting essential items on previous trips, we realized that a structured solution could improve our travel experiences.
  
- What problem does it solve?
  Travel Mosaic addresses the common challenges travelers face by helping them maximize their trips through effective planning and organization. By keeping everything in one place, users can focus more on enjoying their adventures.

- What did we learn?
  This project helped us learn how to you use github and version control on a collaborative project. We also learned about Tailwind CSS and merging conflicts.
